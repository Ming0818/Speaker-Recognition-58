# Speaker-Recognition

The main aim is to implement Speaker Recognition system.It takes voice of 4 different speakers and tries to identify the speaker.The voices were recorded in both noisy and noise less environment.The results showed that the system works effectively in the noise less environment recognising all 4 voices corrently whereas in noisy environment 3 speakers were identified correctly.

REQUIREMENTS:
1.PYTHON 3.6
2.import numpy
3.import scipy
4.import matplotlib

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM:
1.Download all python files.
2.Download the train and test folder for noise less environment from dataset and place both the folders in the same directory in which python files were downloaded.
3.RUN test.py to carry out testing for noise less environment.
4. Similarly now change the train and test folder with the noisy 
5.Ensure that test and train folder is in the same directory as test.py before running test.py
