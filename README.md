# Speaker-Recognition

The main aim is to implement Speaker Recognition system.It takes voice of 4 different speakers and tries to identify the speaker.The voices were recorded in both noisy and noise less environment.The results showed that the system works effectively in the noise less environment recognising all 4 voices corrently whereas in noisy environment 3 speakers were identified correctly.

REQUIREMENTS:
1.PYTHON 3.6
2.import numpy
3.import scipy
4.import matplotlib

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM:
1.COPY AND PASTE ALL FILES of noise-less folder in the same directory in your computer
2.RUN test.py to carry out testing 
3.Ensure that test and train folder is in the same directory as test.py
4.Similarly implement the program for noisy folder.
